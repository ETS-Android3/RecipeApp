  <br> <strong>Group Members:</strong> Tiffany, Paul, Billy</br>
  <br> <strong>Project Title:</strong> Lightweight recipe suggesting & shopping app.</br>
  <br> <strong>Project Description:</strong> Simple Chef is a lightweight recipe application developed in Android Studio for Android phones. The application displays a list of recipes that the user can click on to get ingredients and instructions for. Additionally, users are able to favorite their most liked recipes as well as add their own recipes to save for the future. Our hope is that Simple Chef will provide users with an easy way to select different foods to cook when they're unsure or indecisive of what they want.</br>

## Executive Summary

<p align="justify">
Simple Chef was created with a target audience of home or ameture chefs in mind. The recipes that are offered within our application are not difficult to make and offer users a lot of room to make recipes unique and their own. Additionally, Simple Chef offers the feature to add one's own recipes, thus allowing home cooks the opportunity to easily keep track of their recipes that they enjoy. Should a user truly not know what to make, the application offers a randomizer button that will provide a random recipe from the application.
